# cs1110-TA
My work I've done as a TA (without student data)

Lab Grades Script (modified version of Kal Buterbaugh's (Class of 2022) lab_grades.py)
 - Includes a script that takes in an Excel spreadsheet containing student attendance data (ex. Example CS1110 Lab Attendance Sheet.xlsx) and transforms it into another spreadsheet with a specific formatting required for University of Virginia's course website based on Collab
 - Example of output spreadsheet is located in Lab01 called "grades.csv"
 - Student data was anonymized with the removal of student names and the addition of randomly generated computing ID's
